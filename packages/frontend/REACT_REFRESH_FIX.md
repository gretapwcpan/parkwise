# React Refresh Fix for Monorepo Setup

## Problem
In a monorepo setup, Create React App's webpack configuration tries to import `react-refresh/runtime` from the root `node_modules` directory instead of the frontend's local `node_modules`, causing runtime errors.

## Solution: Using CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override)

### Step 1: Install CRACO
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --save-dev @craco/craco
```
✅ Already installed in `devDependencies`

### Step 2: Create craco.config.js
Created `frontend/craco.config.js` with the following configuration:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    configure: (webpackConfig) => {
      // Fix for react-refresh in monorepo
      webpackConfig.resolve = {
        ...webpackConfig.resolve,
        alias: {
          ...webpackConfig.resolve.alias,
          'react-refresh/runtime': require.resolve('react-refresh/runtime'),
        },
      };
      
      // Ensure modules are resolved from frontend's node_modules first
      webpackConfig.resolve.modules = [
        path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules'),
        'node_modules',
      ];
      
      return webpackConfig;
    },
  },
};
```

This configuration:
- Creates an alias for `react-refresh/runtime` to resolve it correctly
- Prioritizes the frontend's `node_modules` directory for module resolution

### Step 3: Update package.json scripts
Modified the scripts in `package.json` to use `craco` instead of `react-scripts`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "craco start",
  "build": "craco build",
  "test": "craco test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

### Step 4: Remove the workaround
Removed `FAST_REFRESH=false` from `.env` file since the issue is now properly fixed.

## How to Run
Simply start the frontend as usual:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Benefits
- ✅ React Fast Refresh (hot module replacement) works properly
- ✅ No runtime errors about missing modules
- ✅ Instant updates when you modify React components
- ✅ Better development experience with preserved component state

## Verification
The application should:
1. Load without any React Refresh errors in the console
2. Show "Connected" status in the UI
3. Display surrounding information when location is selected
4. Update instantly when you modify components (without full page refresh)
