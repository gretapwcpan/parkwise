# Hashtag Discovery Feature

## Overview
The Hashtag Discovery feature allows users to click on location hashtags to discover and visualize similar locations on the map with animated circles.

## How It Works

### 1. Right-Click to Pin Location
- Right-click anywhere on the map to pin a location (ðŸ“Œ marker appears)
- Location Intelligence panel opens automatically

### 2. Click on Hashtags
- Each hashtag in the Location Intelligence panel is clickable
- Clicking a hashtag activates it (shows with gradient background)
- Multiple hashtags can be active simultaneously

### 3. Visual Feedback on Map
When a hashtag is clicked:
- **Animated Circles**: Pulsing colored circles appear at locations with the same vibe
- **Color Coding**: Each hashtag type has a unique color:
  - ðŸ”´ #FoodieParadise - Red
  - ðŸ”µ #BusyArea - Teal
  - ðŸŸ¢ #CafeHopping - Green
  - ðŸŸ¡ #ShoppingDistrict - Yellow
  - ðŸŸ£ #NightlifeHub - Purple

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- **LocationVibe.js**: Handles hashtag clicks and active state
- **MapView.js**: Renders animated circles on map
- **App.js**: Manages hashtag locations state

### Mock Data Generation
Currently uses mock data to demonstrate functionality:
- Generates 5-15 random locations per hashtag
- Assigns match strength (50-100%)
- Distributes locations around user position

### Animation
- CSS pulse animation for circles
- 2-second animation cycle
- Scale and shadow effects

## Future Enhancements

### Backend Integration
- Store analyzed locations in database
- Real-time hashtag matching algorithm
- Machine learning for vibe similarity

### Advanced Features
- Multi-hashtag filtering (AND/OR logic)
- Hashtag popularity heat maps
- Save favorite hashtag combinations
- Share vibe profiles with friends
- Navigate to best match locations

### UI Improvements
- Hashtag cloud visualization
- Filter by match strength
